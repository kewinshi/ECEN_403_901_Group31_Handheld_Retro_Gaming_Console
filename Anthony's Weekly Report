Anthony's Report
This week I mainly worked on researching for hardware parts for the console.
I was able to find the microcontroller of choice to be the STM32 NUCLEO-F103RB and will use STM32Cub as my IDE to embed code into the microcontroller.
In this coming week I will start writing pseudocode to operate the power system of the pcb
I have also decided that the sound system of the console will be a piezo buzzer and the controls will be digital buttons that will connect to the GPIO of the NUCLEO microcontroller
The power supply will be a plug in the wall and the the regulator will be a LDO that will convert the voltage down to 3V. I will work on current regulation this week.
My main plan this week is to start buying parts and start figuring out which AC/DC converter, LDO, and buttons that we will be using as well as create the logic of coding the microcontroller and PCB design.
I will also finish a very general flow chart of the hardware.
