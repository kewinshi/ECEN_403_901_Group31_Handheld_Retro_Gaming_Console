Status Report
_____________
Things Accomplished:
  - Finalized the IDE choice and installed it successfully.
  - We have a general block diagram for the whole project.
  - 
In Progress:
  - Starting to familiarize with STM32CubeIDE and programming code in it.
  - Finalize on microcontroller and compatabile peripheral parts and purchasing them.
  - 


Setbacks:
  - Relative passed away, costing approximately four days of work. 
  - Had a trouble installing IDE. Website had a loop of account verification and software installations.


Week 6:

Things Accomplished:
   - Coded game logic and pseudo display for first game
   - Working on minimum viable product (MVP) for first game by driving a simulated display

Week 7:

Things accomplished
   - Finished subsytem introduction project
   - Started coding breakout logic

Issues Encountered:
   - Snake file got corrupted somehow. Had to rewrite the code.



Week 8: 

Things accomplished:
   - Compiled and presented bi-weekly progress presentation.
   - Ordered hardware including displays.
In progress:
   - Compiling code in STM32CubeIDE instead of in VSCODE
   - Getting display connected and driver working with display

Issues encountered:
   - Dr. Lusher has pointed out that code needs to start being compiled in the microcontroller environment to avoid future compilation headaches.
   - Parts were not ordered correctly.
